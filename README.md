# 30-Day JavaScript Challenge

## Overview

Hello, I'm Syed Rizwan, a Full Stack Java Developer . Despite my background in Java, I recognize the importance of constantly revisiting and refining my skills in other key technologies. To this end, I've decided to embark on a 30-day JavaScript challenge.

## Objectives

### Revise JavaScript
